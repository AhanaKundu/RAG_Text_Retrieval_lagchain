# RAG_Text_Retrieval_lagchain
This repository contains two mini projects built using **LangChain** and integrated with **LangSmith** for tracing and observability:

1. **RAG from YouTube Transcript**  
   A Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline that ingests a YouTube transcript and enables question answering over it.

2. **RAG-enabled Chatbot from PDF**  
   A chatbot application that uses RAG to provide context-aware answers from a PDF document.

Both projects are fully traceable with LangSmith, making it easier to debug and monitor the LLM workflows.
